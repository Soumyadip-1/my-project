Docker Multi-Stage Build for React Applications

This project demonstrates how to use Docker multi-stage builds to efficiently containerize a React application.
By separating the build and runtime phases, the final Docker image remains lightweight, secure, and optimized for production.

Key Features

Uses multi-stage Docker builds to separate build and runtime environments.

Reduces final image size by removing unnecessary dependencies and tools.

Ensures consistent application behavior across all environments (development, staging, production).

Improves deployment speed and resource efficiency.

How It Works

Build Stage:
The React source code is compiled and bundled using Node.js in an isolated environment.

Runtime Stage:
Only the optimized build output is copied into a minimal web server image (e.g., Nginx) for serving the application.

Benefits

Smaller, faster, and more secure Docker images.

Cleaner separation between build-time and runtime dependencies.

Easy to maintain and scalable for production environments.
